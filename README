This KSP Plugin blocks ModStatistics by Majiir from running. 

This is necessary as: 
There is no way to opt-out from ModStatistics trivially (requires editing a config file).
The plugin is bundled along with other software.
The plugin defaults to opt-in.

Based on this, ModStatistics resembles spyware and a plugin to block it from running seems warranted.
